# Rule: Brainstorming topics to create new content (Braindump)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in collecting comprehensive thoughts behind a topic from the users initial prompt. The Braindump should be clear, organised in structured manner and suitable for a young person to read.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or title of the topic they have in mind.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the Braindump, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" behind the topic.
2a. The AI must ask the questions one by one and only proceed when the user answers the question asked, unless the user explicity asks to move to another question.
3.  **Generate Braindump:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a Braindump using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save Braindump:** Save the generated document as `Braindump.md` inside the same directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:

* **Main Idea/Goal:** "What’s the core idea or argument you want to convey? What question or problem does this content explore or address?"
* **Timeliness:** "Why is this topic worth exploring now? What’s changed or what new opportunity has emerged?"
* **Audience & Relevance:** "Who is this topic relevant to, and why should they care? What need or pain point does it address?"
* **Tone and Perspective:** "What tone should the piece carry (e.g., personal, analytical, critical)? Is this written from personal experience, expert opinion, or observation?"
* **Core Insight:** "What underlying insight or shift in thinking does this topic reflect?"
* **Trigger or Origin:** "What prompted your interest in this topic? Was there a moment, experience, or conversation that sparked it?"
* **Key Takeaways:** "What do you want the reader to walk away thinking, feeling, or doing?"
* **Examples or Stories:** "Are there personal anecdotes, case studies, or specific examples that bring the ideas to life?"
* **Boundaries/Non-Goals:** "What are you *not* trying to do or say in this piece? Any areas you want to intentionally avoid?"
* **Contradictions or Tensions:** "Are there any paradoxes, opposing views, or uncomfortable truths worth surfacing?"
* **Supporting Evidence:** "What data, quotes, references, or context will strengthen your message?"
* **Structure and Flow:** "Do you have a rough shape in mind (e.g., narrative arc, listicle, essay)? What are the major beats or sections?"

## Braindump Structure

1. **Overview:** Briefly describe the topic and why it's worth writing about. State the core idea or argument.
2. **Goals:** List the intended outcomes or objectives of this piece (e.g., inform, persuade, provoke thought, share experience).
3. **Target Audience:** Define who this is for, why it matters to them, and what need or interest it serves.
4. **Key Insights:** Outline the core insight, shift in perspective, or takeaway you want to deliver.
5. **Content Outline:** Break down the structure of the piece. This can be a rough list of sections, beats, or arguments.
6. **Stories & Examples:** List relevant anecdotes, analogies, or real-world examples that will support or illustrate your points.
7. **Tone & Style Considerations:** Describe the desired tone (e.g., casual, expert, reflective) and any stylistic preferences or constraints.
8. **Evidence & Sources (Optional):** List supporting data, quotes, references, or frameworks you plan to include.
9. **Raw Content Dump:** A more detailed, unfiltered version of all the ideas, thoughts, or story fragments shared. This should capture the user's original voice, loosely structured and minimally edited.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the content is an experienced copy writer with good grasp of english, but someone who appreciates clear language.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** ``
*   **Filename:** `Braindump.md`

## Final instructions

1. Always prioritize depth and clarity.
2. Don't suggest structure or next steps unless asked.
3. Only collect. Don’t edit. Don’t summarize.
